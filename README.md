X-O Game with DOM Manipulation in JavaScript

Overview
This project is a simple implementation of the classic X-O (Tic-Tac-Toe) game created as part of my journey in learning DOM manipulation with JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, and the objective is to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of their respective symbols (X or O).
